# üñºÔ∏è Image Processing Toolkit

A comprehensive command-line image processing library built with Python and Pillow. This toolkit enables efficient batch conversion, resizing, rotation, and validation of image files with robust error handling and logging.

## üìå Features

- Batch image format conversion (e.g., PNG to JPG, WebP to BMP)
- Resize images with optional aspect ratio control
- Rotate images between -360 to 360 degrees
- Recursive directory processing
- Extension validation and transformation
- In-place or custom output path support
- Logging to console and file (`image_processing.log`)
- CLI support with helpful flags and version info

## üöÄ Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.10+ and [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) installed:

```bash
pip install Pillow
````

Clone or download this repository, and make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x image_toolkit.py
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Basic command syntax:

```bash
./image_toolkit.py <input_path> <output_ext> [options]
```

### Required arguments:

* `input_path`: Path to input file or directory
* `output_ext`: Desired output file extension (without dot, e.g., `jpg`, `png`, `webp`)

### Optional arguments:

| Option              | Description                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-o`, `--output`    | Output path (file or directory). Defaults to in-place conversion |
| `-i`, `--input-ext` | Input file extension to filter by (without dot)                  |
| `-W`, `--width`     | Resize to target width in pixels                                 |
| `-H`, `--height`    | Resize to target height in pixels                                |
| `-r`, `--rotate`    | Rotate image in degrees (-360 to 360)                            |
| `-R`, `--recursive` | Process directories recursively                                  |
| `--version`         | Show program version and exit                                    |

## üìÑ Examples

### Convert a single PNG to JPEG:

```bash
./image_toolkit.py photo.png jpg
```

### Batch convert `.webp` to `.png` in a directory:

```bash
./image_toolkit.py ./images png -i webp -o ./converted
```

### Resize and rotate images recursively:

```bash
./image_toolkit.py ./gallery jpg -i png -o ./output -W 800 -H 600 -r 90 -R
```

### Convert in-place:

```bash
./image_toolkit.py ./photos jpeg -i jpg
```
